# Quick Sort and Count Sort algorithm analysis in Big O Notation
This exercise required me to analyse, and make a critical comparison between, alternative designs of algorithms and data structures based on efficiency and scalability concerns.

- In the code:
  - **MainApp.java** – A Main class with a main() method for running. The main() method contains sample code that tests each algorithm.
  - **CountSort.java** – A class containing an implementation of Count Sort.
  - **QuickSort.java** – A class containing an implementation of Quick Sort.

## Terminology
- Temporal complexity
  - How long the algorithm takes to run.
  - Obtained by counting the number of comparisons and the number of copies required.
- Spatial complexity
  - The resources the algorithm requires.
  - Obtained by counting the number of additional array elements necessary to perform the algorithms.
